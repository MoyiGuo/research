## Welcome to Moyi's Pageüêù

I am currently a MS student enrolled in the Quantitative Computational Finance program at Georgia Tech. 

Prior to this, I received my Bachelor Degrees in both Economics and Applied Mathematics (double major) at [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html) in 2018 where I worked with [Prof. Michael R.Powers](http://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/powers) on the topic of prediction on default risks. I was also a research assistant for [Prof. Alexander Cowles White](http://alex-white.net) and developed the topic of evolutionary game theory under incomplete information as my bachelor thesis in Economics. Besides, my mathematics bachelor thesis was supervised by [Prof. Jiaxin Hu](http://faculty.math.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jxhu/).
